RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_1,Some monsters are actually pretty shy. [pause]I think I can relate.
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_2,"{player}, have you ever tried being a Traffikrab? [pause]Like [wave amp=30 freq=10]really being[/wave] a Traffikrab?"
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_3,It's an experience.
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_4,Hey there! [pause]Record anything interesting today?
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_5,There have been more floods lately. 
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_6,Sometimes[pause] I just like dashing through the forest! 
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_7,"I picked up a strange sticker the other day.[pause] It doesn't seem to do anything, but my opponent always looks [wave amp=30 freq=10]so annoyed[/wave]!"
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_8,I still have no idea how I got here.[pause] I'm not sure I want to go back though!
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_9,"Harbourtown could use some new shops.[pause] Coffee is great[pause], but I'd do anything for a new pair of shoes!"
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_10,I was battling this ranger the other day[pause] and he transformed into a Khepri and used Headshot like [wave amp=30 freq=15]7 times in a row[/wave]. I didn't even get a turn!
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_11,What are we going to do if the Mall runs out of tapes?[pause] I don't even want to think about it!
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_12,I was in my bathtub when I suddenly appeared here…[pause] I didn't even get to rinse my hair!
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_13,Do you think the monsters here might be…[pause][wave amp=30 freq=15]edible[/wave]?
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_14,The most incredible thing washed up on the beach last night…[pause] It was a cartridge of my favorite childhood game![pause] Now if only I could find the [wave amp=30 freq=15]game console[/wave] to use it with...
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_15,I heard the mall is haunted![pause] I can't wait to bring a ghost home as a pet!
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_16,"The other night, I gazed out into the infinite void of the ocean.[pause] It called to me.[pause] It said [wave amp=30 freq=10]""bikini season is only 4 months away""[/wave]![pause] Oh the horror!"
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_17,"There's this rumor[pause], if you play your tapes backwards it would summon a demon god!"
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_18,I had a brilliant idea![pause] I'm going to use two cassette players to play two different tapes![pause] Do you think I'll fuse with myself?
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_19,Cassettes?[pause] I prefer MP3 players myself.
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_20,How did I even get here? [pause]Last thing I remember was getting hit by a truck!
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_21,"I used to be a great ranger like yourself, but then a Nevermort spit on my knee!"
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_22,
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_23,
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_24,
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_25,
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_26,
RECRUIT_PASSIVE_ROGUE1,There's been another rogue sighting![pause] We need all available rangers!
RECRUIT_PASSIVE_ROGUE2,I'm not sure I can take this one alone! [pause] Can anyone lend a hand?
RECRUIT_PASSIVE_ROGUE3,That rogue is getting out of control! Where are the captains!?
RECRUIT_PASSIVE_ROGUE4,This rogue already killed my partner! [pause] He was just 3 days from retirement too!
RECRUIT_PASSIVE_ROGUE5,"I'll help put this rogue down, but don't expect me to hang around if things go south!"
RECRUIT_PASSIVE_ROGUE6,We can't let this rogue get too close to town!
RECRUIT_MENU_OPTION1,Invite {pawn} to Party

RECRUIT_MENU_OPTION5,Play Card Game
RECRUIT_MENU_OPTION4,Goodbye!
RECRUIT_MENU_PLAYCARDS1,A card game on a weird interdimensional island filled with dangerous monsters?[pause][pause] Of course I'll play!
RECRUIT_MENU_PLAYCARDS2,"Ok[pause], but I'll have you know I'm pretty good at these!"
RECRUIT_MENU_PLAYCARDS3,Let's stake our livelyhood and the fate of our world...[pause] on a card game!
RECRUIT_MENU_PLAYCARDS4,Sounds like a great way to take my mind off the impending doom and existential dread!
RECRUIT_MENU_PLAYCARDS5,I spent all night building my deck![pause] Time to take it for a spin!
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_LOSE1,"Aw, dang it. I gotta find better cards."
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_LOSE2,I knew I should have swapped my stance on the last card!
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_LOSE3,Next time I'll use more remaster combos!
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_LOSE4,"Argh! Fine[pause], you can have my card!"
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_LOSE5,I'm not going to be a sore loser about it.[pause] Here's your prize.
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_LOSE6,I'm definitely not going to obsess over this later.
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_WIN1,"It's all in the heart of the cards, you know?"
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_WIN2,Shift your stance into Defending when you're low on health! After blocking damage you'll heal for the leftover defense points!
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_WIN3,Ha! I've still got it![pause] It's all about Balance!
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_WIN4,Did you know?[pause] You keep your Remaster Bonus even if your next card causes you to change stance!
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_WIN5,Alright![pause] I'll become a champion in no time!
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_WIN6,"Playing all the cards for a full remaster gives greater bonuses than partial remasters, but they can be so hard to setup!"
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_ACCEPT1,"Sure, I've got some free time!"
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_ACCEPT2,"I guess I can lend a hand, if you [wave amp=30 freq=10]really[/wave] need it."
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_ACCEPT3,"We're not doing anything too dangerous[pause], are we?"
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_REJECT1,"It seems like you've got your hands full, maybe later! "
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_REJECT2,I'm a bit anxious around this many people. Can we hang out some other time?
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_REJECT3,Lose the extra pair of hands first.
RECRUIT_MENU_GOODBYE1,See you around!
RECRUIT_MENU_GOODBYE2,"Don't go too far, in case I need help…"
RECRUIT_MENU_GOODBYE3,"Fine, I was in the middle of something anyway. "
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_ACCEPT1,"Sure, I could use the warm up!"
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_ACCEPT2,"Alright, but don't blame me for what happens next."
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_ACCEPT3,"You'll go easy on me[pause], right?"
RECRUIT_CHALLENGE_WIN1,That was more of a workout than I expected!
RECRUIT_CHALLENGE_WIN2,I was still getting warmed up.
RECRUIT_CHALLENGE_WIN3,"{player}, you really don't pull your punches do you?"
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_REJECT1,I'm still catching my breath from our last round! Maybe we can go again tomorrow?
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_REJECT2,Are you [wave amp=30 freq=10]trying[/wave] to humiliate me? Go pick on somebody else for a while.
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_REJECT3,"I don't think I can keep up with you, {player}. I need some time to rethink my strategy!"
FOLLOWER_DEFAULT_INTERACTION,[i]Dismiss {pawn} from your party?[/i]
FOLLOWER_IDLE_DIALOG1,"Hey {player}, need something?"
FOLLOWER_IDLE_DIALOG2,You and {partner} seem like a great team. I hope I can find somebody like that!
FOLLOWER_IDLE_DIALOG3,I heard some weird stuff happens here in {region_name}. Maybe we can wrap up and go hang out at the Café?
FOLLOWER_IDLE_DIALOG4,How long have you been using that {first_tape_name} tape? We should go record one for me to try out!
FOLLOWER_IDLE_DIALOG5,How's it going?
FOLLOWER_IDLE_DIALOG6,I'm so pumped! What's next?
FOLLOWER_MENU_OPTION1,Yes
FOLLOWER_MENU_OPTION2,No
FOLLOWER_DISMISSED1,"Darn, things were just starting to get interesting!"
FOLLOWER_DISMISSED2,"Oh, alright. I'll go work on my sticker collection then."
FOLLOWER_DISMISSED3,"Done already? Alright, I'll see you around then!"
RECRUIT_TRADE_OFFER1,I really need [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] to complete my newest strategy. I'm willing to offer [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] in exchange!
RECRUIT_TRADE_OFFER2,I've been looking everywhere for [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color]! If you're interested I'll trade [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for it.
RECRUIT_TRADE_OFFER3,"If you've got any spare [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] stickers laying around, I'll gladly give you my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for it."
RECRUIT_TRADE_OFFER4,"[color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] is the missing piece to my perfect winning strategy! You can have [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for it, if you promise not to tell anybody about my amazing setup!"
RECRUIT_TRADE_OFFER5,Would you be willing to trade [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] for my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] sticker?
RECRUIT_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,"Finally, this [color=#{request_rarity}]{trade_request}[/color] sticker will make me invincible!"
RECRUIT_TRADE_ACCEPTED2,Thanks! I hope [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] is useful to you!
RECRUIT_TRADE_ACCEPTED3,What a steal! I would have gladly traded [wave amp=30 freq=10]two[/wave] [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] stickers!
RECRUIT_TRADE_REJECTED1,What kind of fool do you take me for? That's not [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color]!
RECRUIT_TRADE_REJECTED2,If you didn't have [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] all you had to do was say so…
RECRUIT_TRADE_REJECTED3,What am I supposed to do with this? I really needed [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] to complete my collection!
RECRUIT_TRADE_MENU_OPTION1,"Sure, here you go!"
RECRUIT_TRADE_MENU_OPTION2,No way!
RECRUIT_TRADE_CANCEL1,Dang it! Now what am I going to do?!
RECRUIT_TRADE_CANCEL2,"Oh, okay. Thanks for considering it."
RECRUIT_TRADE_CANCEL3,I guess I'll have to keep checking the sticker merchants…

EUGENE_INVITE_ACCEPT1,The dynamic crime fighting…[pause] trio?! This is gonna be wild!
EUGENE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG1,"Hey {player}, you out on patrol too? "
EUGENE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG2,It's pretty wild out here! There's a ton of new people ready to help out.
EUGENE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,I got all these crazy stickers from one of the merchants.[pause] I'm gonna be unstoppable!
EUGENE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"I was thinking of trying out a few new battle poses later.[pause] What? Don’t give me that look, it's totally important!"
EUGENE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,"We gotta do more supply runs, can't afford to run low on tapes out there!"
EUGENE_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,"I'd gladly show you a few moves[pause], but I gotta finish up here first. Let's hang later!"
EUGENE_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,Lookin' to learn a few tricks from me? You got it!
EUGENE_CHALLENGE_WIN1,Dang! You got [wave amp=30 freq=10]way[/wave] better at this!
EUGENE_TRADE_OFFER1,"{player}[pause], buddy. I've [wave amp=30 freq=10]gotta[/wave] have [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color]![pause] I'll give ya this [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] sticker if you got any!"
EUGENE_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,Momentous! Now nothing can slow me down!
EUGENE_TRADE_REJECTED1,"Aw man, come on! You know that's what I need! "
EUGENE_TRADE_CANCEL1,"[wave amp=30 freq=10]Fine[/wave][pause], I get it. I'll just keep battling until I earn one!"
EUGENE_CARDS_ACCEPT1,Dude![pause] Of course I'm down to play this![pause] I love collectible card games!
EUGENE_CARDS_LOSE1,"Ugh![pause] I was just about to draw my ace![pause] Ah well[pause], I'll get it next time![pause] Here's your reward!"
EUGENE_CARDS_WIN1,Badass![pause] That was great![pause] Hit me up if you wanna play another round!
EUGENE_LEAVE1,See ya!
EUGENE_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,It's another wild one![pause] I'm taking it down!
FELIX_INVITE_ACCEPT1,Yeah. Sounds like a good time. 
FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG1,Hey there. Not working too hard I hope?
FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG2,"I sketeched this weird monster the other day. Their anatomy was so unorthodox, I couldn't help but get inspired. "
FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,"I broke another pencil rewinding my tape today[pause]. I always keep a spare[pause], but I usually save it for my sketches. "
FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"You know[pause], it's not so bad here![pause] Aside from the wild monsters, it's actually pretty relaxing."
FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,Hey.[pause] I was just enjoying the weather.
FELIX_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,"Actually, I could use a break. Let's pick this up later."
FELIX_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,"Sure, I could use the practice. "
FELIX_CHALLENGE_WIN1,"Wow[pause], you're really something else. "
FELIX_TRADE_OFFER1,I could use an extra [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] sticker.[pause] Maybe you'd be willing to trade for my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] sticker?
FELIX_TRADE_REJECTED1,"Hmm[pause], I don't think that's it.[pause] That's alright, I can probably get it from the merchant stalls."
FELIX_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,"This should smooth things out for me.[pause] I appreciate it, {player}. "
FELIX_CARDS_ACCEPT1,"Woah![pause] Check out the artwork on these cards.[pause] Sure, I'll play a round."
FELIX_CARDS_LOSE1,"Good game.[pause] Here[pause], you can have this."
FELIX_CARDS_WIN1,Rad![pause] That was pretty fun.[pause] Let's play again sometime.
FELIX_TRADE_CANCEL1,"Oh[pause], no worries.[pause] I'm sure I'll find one eventually."
FELIX_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,Looks like another rogue on the loose. I can help!
FELIX_LEAVE1,Take care.
MEREDITH_INVITE_ACCEPT1,"Yeah[pause], alright.[pause] I can make time for that."
MEREDITH_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG1,"Uh[pause], hey there. "
MEREDITH_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG2,So.[pause] Is it just me or…[pause] are there more people here than usual?
MEREDITH_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,"Hey, {player}.[pause] Did you need something?"
MEREDITH_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"Some[pause], uh[pause], odd stuff has been washing up on the beach lately."
MEREDITH_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,Hmm…[pause] I think I'll go record a new tape later.
MEREDITH_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,"Urgh. Fine. I'll humor you this one time, mate."
MEREDITH_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,"I[pause], uh…[pause] got something I gotta do first, mate."
MEREDITH_CHALLENGE_WIN1,"Alright, fine.[pause] You earned that one."
MEREDITH_TRADE_OFFER1,"So[pause], if you've got any [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] stickers laying around.[pause] I wouldn't mind trading my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for it. If you're interested."
MEREDITH_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,"Thanks, mate.[pause] I needed this one."
MEREDITH_TRADE_REJECTED1,Urgh.[pause] I'm pretty sure I was clear on which bloody sticker I needed.
MEREDITH_TRADE_CANCEL1,"Yeah[pause], I figured as much."
MEREDITH_CARDS_ACCEPT1,Uhm.[pause] When did a whole bloody card game wash up on shore?
MEREDITH_CARDS_LOSE1,"Well[pause], that was[pause] interesting.[pause] I guess[pause], here's your reward."
MEREDITH_CARDS_WIN1,"Heh[pause], I guess I'm pretty good at this."
MEREDITH_LEAVE1,"Take care, mate."
MEREDITH_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,Not another one![pause] Can somebody just…[pause] urgh! Somebody help me out here!
VIOLA_INVITE_ACCEPT1,Splendid![pause] A new adventure awaits us!
VIOLA_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG1,"I am glad to see you well, friend!"
VIOLA_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG2,I can see the allure to this new lifestyle. 
VIOLA_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,Another fine day for adventure! 
VIOLA_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,May this day find you well!
VIOLA_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,Greetings friend!
VIOLA_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,You mean to test thy mettle against a worthy opponent? I humbly accept your request!
VIOLA_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,"Alas, I fear my current condition would not make our sparring worthwhile. I require a moment of respite."
VIOLA_CHALLENGE_WIN1,"Pray tell, where did you learn such impressive feats?"
VIOLA_TRADE_OFFER1,"If I may, I require one [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] sticker to improve upon my current ability. If you would be willing to part with one, I offer thee my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] in exchange!"
VIOLA_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,You have my gratitude!
VIOLA_TRADE_REJECTED1,"Alas, dear friend. This does not resemble the item I requested."
VIOLA_TRADE_CANCEL1,"Fear not, I am resourceful enough to procure one through other means!"
VIOLA_LEAVE1,Fare thee well!
VIOLA_CARDS_ACCEPT1,A game of chance and skill played on small sheets of paper?[pause] How fascinating! 
VIOLA_CARDS_LOSE1,Marvelous! I do believe it is customary to reward the victor with a card from the defeated's arsenal?
VIOLA_CARDS_WIN1,How joyous! I would gladly engage in more of these leisure activities!
VIOLA_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,Rogues have been sighted upon the horizon! Let us show thy fiends our true mettle!
FRANKIE_CARDS_ACCEPT1,Oh oh oh! I've played tons of these back home!
FRANKIE_CARDS_LOSE1,Yes! Ha ha! I've still got it!
FRANKIE_CARDS_WIN1,"You were amazing![pause][pause] Ok ok, [wave amp=30 freq=10]Duelist Kingdom[/wave] rules apply so here's one of my cards! "
FRANKIE_PARTY_INVITE1,Joining the hero's party?! I'm another step closer to legendary status!
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG1,"I accept all quests, no matter [wave amp=30 freq=10]how[/wave] small![pause] You never know which one will move the plot forward!"
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG2,"Usually, in this type of Isekai, I would have some unique ability or abnormally high stat![pause] But I feel…[pause][pause] normal?"
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,"""In Another World As {frankie_tape}!"". It's a pretty catchy title, right?![pause] I might write a fic about it later!"
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"We should write our own theme song![pause][pause] Something catchy like Card Captors![pause]…You had Card Captors on your world[pause], right?"
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,"I tried rewinding my tape with my pinkie[pause], but for some reason it still didn't work… [pause]It's like there's some weird [wave amp=30 freq=10]game logic[/wave] that forces me to use pencils!"
FRANKIE_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,I've had a lot of time to train [wave amp=30 freq=10]off screen[/wave]![pause] It's time to show off my new special attack![pause][wave amp=30 freq=10] {frankie_attack}![/wave]
FRANKIE_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,I need to finish my training montage first!
FRANKIE_CHALLENGE_WIN1,Ow…[pause] I think I bit my tongue. 
FRANKIE_TRADE_OFFER1,"If I could just get my hands on one more [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] sticker, my PvP build would be [wave amp=30 freq=10]so broken[/wave]! I've got an extra [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] I can trade for it!"
FRANKIE_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,Yes! Finally! I'm completely unstoppable now! [pause]You don't know what PvP is do you...?
FRANKIE_TRADE_REJECTED1,"{player}[pause], I know[pause] that you know[pause] that's not the right sticker…[pause] It's like you're just testing dialog options in a Visual Novel."
FRANKIE_TRADE_CANCEL1,Back to the grind then.
FRANKIE_LEAVE1,See ya!
FRANKIE_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,[wave amp=30 freq=10]Ahhhh!!![/wave] I'm making a big heroic entrance! 
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG1,"Captain, I can't decide between Headshot and Last Rites…"
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG2,Mourningtown has been trying to get more involved in day to day Ranger activities. [pause]I'm going to keep doing my part!
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,Training has been so hard lately![pause] I don't know where Frankie gets all that energy from.
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"I'm going to get stronger! I'll make sure Mourningtown can hold their heads up high again, one day."
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,Hey Captain! Did you need something?
VIN_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,I'll show you how strong I've become!
VIN_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,I think I sprained something. Let's pick this up again later.
VIN_CHALLENGE_WIN1,Dang it. I was so sure I had you that time!
VIN_TRADE_OFFER1,[color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] would be a great addition to my arsenal. I can trade you this [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for it.
VIN_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,Great! I'll be taking down Rogues in half the time with this setup!
VIN_TRADE_REJECTED1,That's not it. I'll just get it myself.
VIN_TRADE_CANCEL1,"Alright, thanks for checking. "
VIN_LEAVE1,See ya around.
VIN_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,I'll put this Rogue down in no time!
VIN_CARDS_ACCEPT1,"I uh..[pause] What?[pause][pause] Alright, I guess I'll play."
VIN_CARDS_WIN1,"Hey, I'm not half bad at this!"
VIN_PARTY_INVITE1,You need my help on an important quest?[pause] Of course I can lend you my strength!
VIN_CARDS_LOSE1,"Well[pause], I didn't really know what I was doing there."
